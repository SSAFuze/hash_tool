# hash_tool
Part of a GCI 2019 task, I decided to build a Python script to work with hashing

# Running the tool

Simply download the source from this repository and whilst in this directory, run:

```
python3 hash.py
```

and then the options should appear.

(you will need the python library 'hashlib' installed for this tool to work)
